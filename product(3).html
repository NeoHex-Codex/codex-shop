                        This tool is Jam packed with features that you can use. Lets start simple. The first feature is the ability to have
                        custom profile pics on IXL, a pretty dull and childish website!! The second feature is the ability to actually save
                        the images you added in a the same place you pick the usual and default profile pictures. You can later delete any picture
                        or make it your profile picture. If you would like to have some NSFW images saved that you don't want anyone to see you can add a password
                        which will restrict access to images and features such as delete and more until the correct password is inputted!!

                        and depends on what you bought a reciept. But for now Ill tell you how to change your profile picture.
                        First go to IXL. The first button you will see after you login will be the change profile picture button.
