                <h3 class="paragraph-title">What are the prices?</h3><br/>
                <p class="paragraphs">
                    Prices can change depending on what's happening at school. 
                    For example during Final season prices may go up due to high demand. 
                    Prices will usually be between 5-15 dollars but are subject to change. 
                    The recommended time to purchase any tool is 1-2 weeks before any big tests happening at school.
