                        While this tool is active it will completely restrict access to Pupilpath!!
                        When Pupilpath is opened it will display a very legit looking error screen carefully designed 
                        in order to ensure that your parents fall for it!! 
                        After the parent clicks retry 3 times, panic mode will activate as a final defense mecahnism
                        It will completely bug the website making sure it is in accessable until the tool is turned off!!
                        To see what it looks like scroll down and see images!!
