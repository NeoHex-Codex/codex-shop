                        While this tool is active it will completely restrict access to Google Classroom!!
                        When Google Classroom is opened it will display a very legit looking error screen carefully designed 
                        in order to ensure that your parents and teachers fall for it!! 
                        It will completely bug the website making sure it is in accessable until the tool is turned off!!
                        You can take a picture and send it your teacher during online learning!!
