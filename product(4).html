                        This tool gives you the ability to change grades only on the dashboard. 
                        To change all grades even after a class is clicked you will have to purchase <a href="/codex-shop/product(6).html">Pupilpath Grade Changer Pro</a>.
                        This one also gives you the ability to change the format in which grades are shown, such as a gpa format and letter format.
                        It also shows you your overall average in whatever format you chose.
