                        I will only accept payments on normal school days. This excludes holidays, half-days, and anything along those lines.
                        To increase the chances of getting the tool faster, please pay at the same exact time,day and place in order to decrease any of delay. I will only wait 10 minutes at specified location.
                        If you are not present within that time-interval, I will leave.
                        You will then have to make a new appointment at some other day,some other time and some other place because appointments can not happen at the same settings.
                        These appointments should not be conspicuous and have to remain very confidential!!
                        Please pick times between 3:00 to 3:10 pm or between 8:00 to 8:30 am if you want to recieve your product on time.
                        If you pick any other times, please expect to pay 4-5 dollars extra. 
                    </p>
